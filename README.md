# Summary

Budgets for schools and school districts are huge, complex, and unwieldy. It's no easy task to digest where and how schools are using their resources. **Education Resource Strategies** is a non-profit that tackles just this task with the goal of letting districts be smarter, more strategic, and more effective in their spending.

To compare expenditure data across districts,schools budgets are distributed into certain categories in a comprehensive financial spending framework. For instance, `Object_Type` describes what the spending "is"â€”Salary, Benefits, Stipends, Equipment, or Property Rental. Other categories describe what the spending "does," which groups of students benefit, and where the funds come from.

Once this process is complete, we can finally offer cross-district insight into a partner's finances. We might observe that a particular partner spends more on facilities and maintenance than peer districts, or staffs teaching assistants more richly.

However, budgets for schools are huge, complex and not standardized, wasting time and labor effort. Machine learning can help automate this process by predicting the probability that a certain label is attached to a budget line item from mostly free-form text features.

The right algorithm, paired with some human checks, will allow us to code financial files more accurately, more quickly, and more cheaply.
